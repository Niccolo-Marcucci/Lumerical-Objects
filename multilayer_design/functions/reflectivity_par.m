% This function computes the reflectivity and trasmissivity of a
% dielectric multilayer stack. The multilayer vector has to include
% the substrate (as first element) and the external medium (as lat
% layer). 
% The thickness of these two layers will not matter, since the
% computation will start at the first interface and will end at the
% last one. Indeed the values of the field r and t will be computed at
% such interfaces. 

function [R,r,t] = reflectivity_par (lambda,theta_in,d,n,pol)

% if you propose a multilayer which is altready optimized for this
% calculation (i.e. no dummy layers and no zero thicknes layers), you
% can comment the next line and save some computational time.
